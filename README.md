# The Criteria
We want to create a cocktail finder app that matches an ingredient to a cocktail.
We want the website to do the following:
-	Have a navbar with each item linking to separate page (multiple html files)
-	Have a search bar where the user can enter an ingredient
-	Use the two APIs (cocktailDB and spoonacular) to return cocktail recipe and match the drink with a random food item
-	Give the user an option to like/dislike the choice of drink and save liked drinks in localStorage
-	Use localStorage to save the search history
-	Create an option to clear history

# How it works
Start by entering the ingredients you have, choose your drink type, and hit the "MixIt!" button to unveil a world of quirky cocktails.

# Used
Bootstrap 5: A front-end framework for building responsive and visually appealing web pages.
