# GrinAndGin: Cocktail Matching Website

GrinAndGin is the app designed to simplify cocktail mixing and culinary pairing.

## Description

Grin And Gin was crafted by three novice web developers: Antonia Yovcheva, Maria Isabel Solana and Anna Chernova as part of the [EdX Skills Bootcamp in Front-End Web Development](https://www.edx.org/boot-camps/coding/skills-bootcamp-in-front-end-web-development).

The application offers a diverse range of cocktail recipes with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. It suggests meals to go with each drink, enables users to save their favorite combinations, and allows exploration of a variety of drink and food recipes.

## Features

1. ### Ingredient input

The user's journey begins by entering an alcoholic or non-alcoholic ingredient through the intuitive interface and selecting the desired drink type. Afterward, the user hits the "MixIt!" button to reveal a world of cocktails.

2. ### Quirky Cocktails

Grin And Gin algorithms analyze entered ingredient to provide users with a collection of cocktail cards, each accompanied by recipes and preparation instructions, that they can craft with the specified ingredient.

3. ### Food Pairing

Users get matching meal suggestions. They also can explore a dedicated page with all food recipes to choose something else.

4. ### Favorites

Users can easily add and remove cocktail recipes to their 'Favorites' with a click. Thanks to localStorage, all liked cocktails are stored on a dedicated page. Users can access their liked cocktails anytime, even after closing the browser, and also delete them from the list if no longer needed.

5. ### Inspiration Hub

Users can browse a variety of all cocktail recipes with the "All" section in the "Cocktails" menu.

6. ### Share with friends
